# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to utilize a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is likely to get a loan. This model will be deployed into a cloud where other users will be able to create a api post request to get results given they provide the necessary data. 

## Hypothesis
(fill in your hypothesis about which subset of applicants will be most likely to have their loan approved, and why. Give some examples of how you will test this hypothesis)

## EDA 
(fill in what you discovered in your exploration of the dataset)


## Process
(fill in what you did during EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, deployment, testing)
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results/Demo
(fill in your model's performance, details about the API you created, and (optional) a link to an live demo)

## Challanges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time? are there any potential issues/biases with your model/use case?)
